 * - [[FileSegmentManagedBuffer]]: data backed by part of a file
 * - [[NioManagedBuffer]]: data backed by a NIO ByteBuffer
 * - [[NettyManagedBuffer]]: data backed by a Netty ByteBuf
 *
 * The concrete buffer implementation might be managed outside the JVM garbage collector.
 * For example, in the case of [[NettyManagedBuffer]], the buffers are reference counted.
 * In that case, if the buffer is going to be passed around to a different thread, retain/release
